Technical Approach
I designed a scalable microservices architecture using Django REST Framework, Next.js, and React Native. The platform integrated smart contracts for secure transactions and PostgreSQL for off-chain data management.

Collaboration and Problem-Solving
I collaborated with design teams using Figma to create user-friendly interfaces. A key challenge was developing a blockchain-based escrow system, which I solved with custom smart contracts and rigorous testing.
